# QuickCommerce Picker Performance Tracker 🛒📊

This project is inspired by my real-life experience working in India’s fast-paced quick-commerce industry (like Zepto, Blinkit, etc.). I’m using this as a foundation to build my Data Science skills from the ground up.

## 🔧 What It Does:
Simulates a daily productivity tracker for warehouse pickers.

It:
- Takes inputs (picker's name, orders packed, hours worked, break time)
- Calculates:
  - Effective working hours
  - Efficiency in orders/hour
  - Daily bonus earned based on performance
- Saves the report to a `.csv` file

---

## 🚀 Learning Milestones

### ✅ Milestone 1: Python Basics
- Learned how to take user input, perform arithmetic, and print reports.
- Created a bonus calculator using `if-else` logic.

### ✅ Milestone 2: Functions and Reusability
- Converted bonus logic into a reusable function (`calculate_bonus()`).
- Improved structure and readability of the code.

### ✅ Milestone 3: Multi-Picker Tracking
- Used `lists`, `loops`, and `dictionaries` to handle multiple pickers.
- Created a summary of daily picker performance.

### ✅ Milestone 4: Export to CSV
- Learned how to use Python’s `csv` module.
- Stored picker performance reports in a `.csv` file for external access.

## 🙌 Why This Project Matters:
This is my first step in transitioning from operations to a career in data science.  
Instead of starting from theory, I’m applying programming to solve problems I personally understand from real experience.
