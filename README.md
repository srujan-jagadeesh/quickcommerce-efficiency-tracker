# QuickCommerce Picker Performance Tracker 🛒📊

This is a beginner Python project inspired by my real-life experience in India’s fast-paced quick-commerce industry (e.g., Zepto, Blinkit, etc.).

## 🔧 What It Does:
This project simulates a picker’s daily report system:
- Takes user inputs: name, orders packed, total hours worked, and break time
- Calculates:
  - Effective work hours
  - Efficiency (orders per hour)
  - Daily bonus based on performance

## 💰 Bonus Logic:
- More than 50 orders → ₹500 bonus
- Between 31–50 orders → ₹200 bonus
- 30 or fewer → ₹0 bonus

## 📂 Files Included:
- `QuickCommerce_Picker_Tracker.ipynb` – Python notebook with inputs & output
- `QuickCommerce_Picker_Tracker.py` – Clean script version of the same logic

## 🛠️ Built With:
- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🙌 Inspired By:
My experience working in the quick-commerce space where tracking productivity and bonuses is crucial.
